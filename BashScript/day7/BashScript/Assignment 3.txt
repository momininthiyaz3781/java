Assignment 3: 
Create a function that takes a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in the file. Call this function from your script with different filenames.

SOLUTION:

# Function to count the number of lines in a file

count_lines() {

  local filename=$1
 
  if [ -f "$filename" ]; then

    local line_count=$(wc -l < "$filename")

    echo "The file '$filename' has $line_count lines."

  else

    echo "The file '$filename' does not exist."

  fi

}
 
# Call the function with different filenames

count_lines "inthu.txt"

count_lines "shaik.txt"

count_lines "momin.txt"
