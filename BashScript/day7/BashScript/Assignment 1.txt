Assignment 1: 
Ensure the script checks if a specific file (e.g., myfile.txt) exists in the current directory. If it exists, print "File exists", otherwise print "File not found".

SOLUTION:

# File name to check

file="inthu.txt"
 
# Check if the file exists

if [ -e "$file" ]; then

  echo "File exists"

else

  echo "File not found"

fi
