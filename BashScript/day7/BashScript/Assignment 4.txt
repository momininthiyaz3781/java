Assignment 4:
Write a script that creates a directory named TestDir and inside it, creates ten files named File1.txt, File2.txt, ... File10.txt. Each file should contain its filename as its content (e.g., File1.txt contains "File1.txt").

SOLUTION:

# Create a directory named TestDirOld

mkdir -p TestDirOld
 
# Change to the TestDirOld directory

cd TestDirOld
 
# Loop to create 10 files

for i in {1..10}; do

  filename="File$i.txt"

  echo "$filename" > "$filename"

done
 
echo "Files created successfully in TestDirOld."
