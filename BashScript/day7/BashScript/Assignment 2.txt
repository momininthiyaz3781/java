Assignment 2: 
Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.

SOLUTION:

# Function to check if a number is odd or even

check_odd_even() {

  if [ $(( $1 % 2 )) -eq 0 ]; then

    echo "$1 is even"

  else

    echo "$1 is odd"

  fi

}													
 
# Loop to read numbers from the user

while true; do

  echo -n "Enter a number (0 to quit): "

  read number

  if [ "$number" -eq 0 ]; then

    echo "Exiting..."

    break

  fi

  check_odd_even "$number"

done
